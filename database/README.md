# Database

This folder is specifically for build-time generation of the airports database. This uses SQLite to generate a database file from a csv. 

> [!WARNING]\
> This folder is _not_ fully automated yet, and requires knowing SQL and SQLite to get it functional, however it ***should not*** need to be edited ever again. 
> The db file is `airports.sqlite` and can be viewed using any sqlite viewer. I used a vscode extension.
